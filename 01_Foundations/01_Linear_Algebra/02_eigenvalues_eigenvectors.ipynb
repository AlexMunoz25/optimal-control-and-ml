    "The eigenvalue problem for a matrix $[A]$ is given by the following equation (eigenvalue equation):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$[A][V] = \\lambda[V] \\iff ([A] - \\lambda[I])[V] = [0]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\lambda$ are the eigenvalues\n",
    "- $V$ are the eigenvectors\n",
    "- $I$ is the identity matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvalue equation states that applying the matrix $[A]$ to an eigenvector $[V]$ results in the same vector scaled by a factor $\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous equation has a non-zero solution $[V]$ if and only if the determinant of the matrix $[A] - \\lambda[I]$ is equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the eigenvalues of $[A]$ are values of $\\lambda$ that satisfy the below equation (characteristic polynomial):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|[A] - \\lambda[I]| = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$ satisfies the eigenvalue equation when we substitute the specific eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To find eigenvectors and eigenvalues:\n",
    "1. Compute the characteristic polynomial $|[A] - \\lambda[I]| = 0$\n",
    "2. Solve for the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ by finding the roots of this polynomial\n",
    "3. For each eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$, solve $([A] - \\lambda_i[I])[V] = [0]$ to find the corresponding eigenvector $[V]$"
