    "#### Notational Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Some authors distinguish between vectors and scalars by notation.  \n",
    "Greek letters $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\ldots)$ may denote scalars, and lowercase Roman letters $(a, x, f, \\ldots)$ denote vectors.  \n",
    "Vectors may also appear in **bold** ($\\mathbf{a}$) or with **arrows above** ($\\vec{a}$).  \n",
    "These conventions vary, so context must clarify meaning.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "For a vector $a$, the $i$-th element is denoted $a_i$.  \n",
    "In mathematical notation, $i$ runs from $1$ to $n$.  \n",
    "When ambiguity arises (e.g., $a_i$ could mean the $i$-th element or $i$-th vector), the context clarifies usage.  \n",
    "To refer to the $j$-th element of vector $a_i$, we write:\n",

    "#### Zero Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A **zero vector** has all elements equal to zero.  \n",
    "It is sometimes denoted:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "0_n\n",

    "where $n$ is the size, or simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation $0$ is overloaded — it may represent scalars or zero vectors, depending on context.  \n",
    "For instance, if $a$ is a 9-vector and $a = 0$, this implies $a$ is the zero vector of size 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unit Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A **unit vector** has all elements zero except one element equal to one.  \n",
    "The $i$-th unit vector of size $n$ is denoted $e_i$.  \n",
