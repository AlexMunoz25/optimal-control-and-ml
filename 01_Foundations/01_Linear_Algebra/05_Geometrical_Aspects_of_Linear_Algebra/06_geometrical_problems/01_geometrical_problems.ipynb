    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrical problems combine the tools developed throughout this chapter \u2014 lines, planes, projections, cross products, and dot products \u2014 to solve practical problems in 2D and 3D.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical problems include: finding intersections of lines and planes, computing distances from points to planes, finding the equation of a plane through three points, and projecting vectors onto planes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the following notebooks tackles a specific type of geometrical problem using the techniques from Sections 5.1\u20135.5."
